beautiful weather, first run in a while, ran round this old barely used road, past sconser quarry, along the coast, past a fish farm, felt good to be out and running. ate just a biscuit and a half and a tea and a coffee, felt good to have very little in me.

ran out along that same road, ran up to the top of the quarry for a great north up the eastern coast of skye. carried back along that road and went for a skinny dip on a beach down off the road. a bit close to a fish farm, which made me think twice, but the water was irressistable. cold and bracing, like 100 cold hands grabbing at my bones.

went down the road to the shops, packed my shoes and shorts so i could go for a little run up this valley from Luib. the weather was so beautiful (and so was the valley) that i couldn’t resist extending it to Torrin bay, then followed the river up from the lochside. iridescent blue pools cut in the rock by the waterfall- i had to take a little dip for a cool off. felt so incredible. carried on up over the pass- such a beautiful valley. back down and found another pool nearly under a bridge that was again a soothe to my aching limbs and a salve to my drying throat. carried on above Donan, by a crumbling church and cut back over the hill to Luib. all magical. (again, had no food before this, felt really good still, no slump, which i think is down to the insulin never going up in the first place, so it has nothing to crash from.)

oof been a while! been so rainy and party at the weekend. waited for a break in the rain, ended up being 6pm, beautiful light, but the chill of autumn has truly set in, ran along the road from through cleadale to the forestry, nice brisk pace to get the warmth flowing through me, then round the back and down past the hydro. beautiful light so ran up to the road from george and sarah’s, then along a bit and down to the catholic church and along the coast.
