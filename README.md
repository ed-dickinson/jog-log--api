# jog-log-api

This is a work in progress, a server providing the API for a simple app, 'Jog-Log' to keep track of my runs. I wanted to move away from using Strava because of privacy concerns and also to free myself from the compulsion of using my Garmin watch. While there are things I find useful, like seeing how often I've run & how far I've run in each shoeâ€“ I wanted to do it in a way that didn't entrench me in the Strava eco-system. Also, I find running a lot more pleasant without constantly checking my pace, pausing the GPS, etc.

I was intitially inspired by the GitHub commits map and wanted something similar for running. A clean and simple, quick-to-read overview of all my running activity.
